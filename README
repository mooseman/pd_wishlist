 *****  README - PD wishlist ***** 

 Just a list of a few things that it would be great to have public-domain 
versions of. 
 If anyone knows of a PD implementation of one of the things on this list 
(or if anyone is actually doing one), I'm very keen to hear about it. 

( The only one of the things below that I'm doing *any* work on 
is a PD readline, and even there, very little work (and poor work at that. 
Anyone else's efforts will be much better. )   


1 -  Git.  "Just because......"  Very nice design, very elegant and has huge 
power in a small package.  
Estimated chance of happening: About 1%  - maybe less.  

2 -  The GRUB boot-loader. Again, "just because....".  There is no doubt that 
GRUB is by far the best, most powerful boot-loader around. However, having a 
PD workalike of it would still be good. It'd be very useful to study and to 
include in any PD operating systems.  
Estimated chance of happening: Almost 0%.    

3 -  Readline/command-history.  A good PD version of this (in C) would be very 
useful.   
Estimated chance of happening: Maybe 2%  

4 -  A PD web browser.  There are lots of browsers out there, but no PD ones. 
Being able to look at the source-code of a PD browser, seeing how the rendering 
works and much more - all of that would be great.  
Estimated chance of happening: Low. Probably less than 1%.    

5 -  A PD file-manager.  Yet another category of apps where there is no public-domain 
version.  
Estimated chance of happening: Reasonable (especially if pdcurses were used). 
Maybe 15-20%  

6 - A standalone PD GUI library.  This is one of the more difficult ones to see happening. 
( There is CGUI out there, but that depends on the non-PD Allegro, so it is not "standalone" ) 
Estimated chance of happening: *Very* low.  Almost 0%.    

7 -  9P  ( Plan 9's network protocol ).  There are already a number of implementations 
of 9P (including a P.D. one in Python). However, a P.D. version in C would be 
great to see.   
Estimated chance of happening: (UPDATED) - 100%!  This has now been done by JuEeHa - his code
is here - https://github.com/JuEeHa/pd9p  
Very many thanks to him for doing this!   

8 -  Plan 9 itself.  A P.D. workalike of this would take care of item 3!  Anyway, of all the 
things on the list, this one is **by far** the least likely to happen, unfortunately.  
What about a P.D. release of the *real* Plan 9? It'd be great to see (and could be a nice 
tribute to the late Dennis Ritchie), but it's **extremely** unlikely to happen. 
Estimated chance of happening:  0%.  Zero.  Zilch.  Nada.  I would give this a negative 
probability if I could.  It's that unlikely. (Sigh...........  If only............... )     

9 - Haskell (or a compact-but-powerful subset of it). There are a number of existing 
Haskell implementations, but none are P.D. This would be a difficult thing to do.  
Estimated chance of happening:  Very low. No more than 1%.    

10 - A PD C compiler. There is some good news in this area.  SubC (a PD compiler 
for a subset of C) has come along - http://www.t3x.org/subc/index.html  
Estimated chance of happening (a full C compiler):  Very hard to guess.  
Now that SubC is here (which could be a very useful base for this) - maybe 20-30%?   

Let's not forget that there is also the PD C library available! A *huge* amount of 
work has gone into that over the years. Very many thanks to Martin Baute (who 
started it's development) and Owen Shepherd (the current maintainer).
