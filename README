 *****  README - PD wishlist ***** 

 Just a list of a few things that it would be great to have public-domain 
versions of. 
 If anyone knows of a PD implementation of one of the things on this list 
(or if anyone is actually doing one), I'm very keen to hear about it. 

( The only one of the things below that I'm doing *any* work on 
is a PD readline, and even there, very little work (and poor work at that. 
Anyone else's efforts will be much better. )   


1 -  Git.  "Just because......"  Very nice design, very elegant and has huge 
power in a small package.  
Estimated chance of happening: About 1%  - maybe less.  

2 -  The GRUB boot-loader. Again, "just because....".  There is no doubt that 
GRUB is by far the best, most powerful boot-loader around. However, having a 
PD workalike of it would still be good. It'd be very useful to study and to 
include in any PD operating systems.  
Estimated chance of happening: Almost 0%.    

3 -  Readline/command-history.  A good PD version of this (in C) would be very 
useful.  
Estimated chance of happening: Maybe 2%  

4 -  9P  ( Plan 9's network protocol ).  There are already a number of implementations 
of 9P (including a P.D. one in Python). However, a P.D. version in C would be 
great to see.   
Estimated chance of happening: 2%  

5 -  Plan 9 itself.  A P.D. workalike of this would take care of item 3!  Anyway, of all the 
things on the list, this one is **by far** the least likely to happen, unfortunately.  
What about a P.D. release of the *real* Plan 9? It'd be great to see (and could be a nice 
tribute to the late Dennis Ritchie), but it's **extremely** unlikely to happen. 
Estimated chance of happening:  0%.  Zero.  Zilch.  Nada.  I would give this a negative 
probability if I could.  It's that unlikely. (Sigh...........  If only............... )     

6 - Haskell (or a compact-but-powerful subset of it). There are a number of existing 
Haskell implementations, but none are P.D. 
Estimated chance of happening:  1%  

7 - A PD C compiler. There is some good news in this area.  SubC (a PD compiler 
for a subset of C) has come along - http://www.t3x.org/subc/index.html  
Estimated chance of happening (a full C compiler):  Very hard to guess.  
Now that SubC is here (which could be a very useful base for this) - maybe 20-30%?   

Let's not forget that there is also the PD C library available! A *huge* amount of 
work has gone into that over the years. Very many thanks to Martin Baute (who 
started it's development) and Owen Shepherd (the current maintainer). 
PDClib is here -  http://pdclib.e43.eu/    

I hope you will support PDClib and SubC. Martin and Owen have put a huge 
amount of work into PDClib.  

Nils Holm (the author of SubC) has put a huge amount of effort into that too.  
He has also written a book on it - here's a link to the page about it -  
http://www.t3x.org/reload/index.html   
I've bought a copy of the book and it's well worth buying, IMO. 


Also - I hope you'll support the PDCore project here -  
http://pdcore.sourceforge.net/#contribute 

From the home page - 
"The pdcore project aims to produce a POSIX.1-2008 compliant public domain 
implementation of the core UNIX(tm) file, shell and text manipulation utilities."  

The author says -  "The project aims to implement all of the non 
development-oriented POSIX.1-2008 shell and utilities, moving on for full coverage 
if possible. This is obviously a fairly large undertaking, and any assistance would be 
very welcome."  

An ***excellent*** start has been made on this, with a number of utilities 
already available.  ***You can make a difference*** by helping out! 
Let's get PD versions of grep and awk out there!
